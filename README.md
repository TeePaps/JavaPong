##This is the home of our CMPSC 221 final project##
* The assignment was to create an Atari style game in java.
* Authors: Sally Hunsberger, Ryan Ottney, and Ted Papaioannou

###To colaborate on this project:###
1. Clone repository to a local directory of your choice
2. Import project into Eclipse workspace

###Recent Changes:###
OnePlayer and GameManager .java files have been sent via email.  (I don't know how to add files to GitHub.)
File doesn't implement any game functionality, simply builds off example in class.
Only working code is menu button (to determine one player / two player mode).

###Task delegation (can be modified if necessary):###
* Sally:  GameManager
* Ted:  Ball/Paddle (separate classes?)
* Ryan:  OnePlayer
